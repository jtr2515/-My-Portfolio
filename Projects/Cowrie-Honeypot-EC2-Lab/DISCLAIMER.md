# DISCLAIMER

This lab was created for **educational purposes only**.

⚠️ No real systems were harmed or accessed during this simulation.  
⚠️ All brute force attempts were directed at a controlled honeypot (Cowrie) on a private EC2 instance.  
⚠️ The IP used (`54.91.232.240`) was under the user's control.

This project helps raise awareness about SSH security and brute-force defense. Unauthorized access to systems without permission is illegal and unethical.
