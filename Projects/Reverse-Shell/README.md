# Reverse-Shell (Educational / Documentation Only)

**Purpose — Education & Defensive Research**

This folder contains documentation and screenshots related to *authorized* learning exercises and defensive research. It is intended solely for educational use, for example:

- explaining how reverse-shell-like behavior is detected and logged,  
- documenting lab setups used to practice detection and incident response, and  
- storing screenshots or notes from approved coursework or exercises.

**Important — Legal & Ethical Notice**

This repository does **not** contain operational or deployable payloads. Any code, commands, IP addresses, or ports that could be used to create a live connection or remote-control capability have been intentionally **redacted** and replaced with placeholders. Do **not** attempt to reproduce or deploy anything in this folder against systems you do not own or do not have explicit written authorization to test.

By using materials in this repository you confirm you will only run tests in isolated lab environments under explicit authorization (for example: your own VM instances, institutional lab, or legally approved red-team engagement).

**Contents**

- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` — step-by-step notes describing how the folder was created and the safe, documented workflow used.  
- `screenshot/` — images from the lab environment (no sensitive/exploitable artifacts).  
- `README.md` (this file) — overview and safety guidance.

**If you are an instructor, student, or analyst**

When performing exercises that resemble offensive techniques, follow these rules:
1. Obtain written authorization for every target you will test.  
2. Use isolated and disposable lab systems (snapshots, isolated VPCs).  
3. Record logs and screenshots for defensive analysis — do not publish live payloads.  
4. Sanitize any uploaded artifacts (remove secrets, IPs, keys) before sharing.

If you need help turning this documentation into a classroom-safe lab guide or a defensive detection playbook, I can help draft that.
